	<p>put me down, &nbsp; let me loose</p>

<p>Isn't it easy to be so PC<br>
you are enlightened (and) you know where to go</p>

<p>You keep repeating what you've been reading<br>
but you don't really know what it means</p>

<p>I see your passion, your eyes are flashing<br>
but there's a thorne in it</p>

<p>You try to stab me cause it don't grab me<br>
and here we go, here we go:</p>

Put me down, let it loose
I don't want to know, I don't want to hear
Put me down, let it loose
I don't need a crutch, Idon't need your touch
Put me down, let it loose,
I don't want to....
Put me down, let it loose,
Put your book aside.....I'm my own muse

You try to save me, it drives me crazy
you know I'm not the least in distress

You can't be cool now, you've been to school now

I'd like to give you my respect
but you ain't giving nothing back.
And I would like to be your friend
but you're only dissin' me so:

Put me down, let it loose.
